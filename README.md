Running through the "I think therefore I blog"  project I got everyting up and running up to the point of 
"Building The Admin Site - part 2" (That would be the video "Django Blog 007b: Creating The Admin Panel - part2")

There was a few hiccups but I managed to clear out a few "H10's" from Heroku and some other stuff and got to the end of 
that video.

Then I got a 404 no matter what I tried to do.

A full day of trying to find the problem I gave up and just deleted the repo and started over again, and finally getting to the 
same place, everything seemed to work just fine. I called it a day and went to bed. Kicking the GitPod workspace and its 404 again.

Still no idea why it doesn't work, I've spent the week trying to figure out how to get past that problem and now, friday night I gave up.

So - here's the submission - the repo (as far as I got) for "I think therefore I blog". It's obvously a fail.

The plan was to merge a version of this into the first submission, to create a blog linked to that homepage. That didn't quite work out though.
